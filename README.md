### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack software developer and love building useful products.

I contribute to open-source as much as I can ([LangChain Python](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain))

I used to work at some fast growing YC startup but now I build LLM applications and consult full-time.

I'm actively building instructive AI Agents (Cats w/ Bats) and sharing my learnings through [LLMSchool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xGUI2ENj-86adpm-USKbg)

If you'd like to chat, feel free to reach out to me [on my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haiphunghiem/).
